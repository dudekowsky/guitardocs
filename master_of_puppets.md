# How To Play (and therefore, Downpick) Master of Puppets...by someone who barely just learned

## Introduction
Hello my Friend, you have come here in your search of the esoteric knowledge on how to play the the second best song of the best Metallica album (the best being Battery, of course).
Maybe this will help you. Maybe it will be just another skipping stone.

Undoubtedly you have come across many trials and have done many different things, but to no avail. You are still searching.
Probably you tried the Youtube speed adjustment feature. Maybe you have downloaded the song off of YouTube and adjusted the speed in your DAW.
Maybe you have been exercising your straight downpicking each day with a metronome and have built a forearm so thick and muscular that everybody tells you get a girlfriend/boyfriend instead. Maybe you are already an accomplished alternate picker and cannot fathom why your girly wrist deviation picking mechanics just doesn't seem to do the job. Maybe you can *sorta* downpick it, but have to resort to cheating on the spider riff.

Maybe you don't even know the notes to it yet (or you do, but you are probably wrong).
In any case, check out Julien Menard who has the best Metallica tabs on YouTube:

I know those sorts of things, because I have been through them all. But I can finally play it as good as I can play any song. 
Without tension, without strain, not yet perfect, but maybe to put that into context, let me introduce myself:
I used to play in some bands in my teenage and student years, but have never been really practicing anything other than drinking beer and picking up girls. So when lockdown almost killed me 4-5 months ago, I got my old trusty Kramer Striker 211 out of the cubbyhole and started playing.
Turns out I didn't know how to play a single song anymore. Not that I ever was really capable of more than playing some simple power chord riffs, strumming chords and really basic pentatonic single notes. So I started practing. I had to relearn everything. How to mute strings which I don't play,
how to hold the pick, how to actually pick and so on. It felt kinda okay, because I could play The Trooper, Knights of Cydonia, and when I was really warm, I could take a shot at Creeping Death, with a rate of about 30% of having to leave out some bars halfway through because of tensing up to the point at which I could play anymore. 
But then I wanted more. I wanted to play Master of Puppets. And I wanted to play it properly, in the right tempo, like Hetfield plays it. Not to be able to play it, but rather to improve as a guitar player. 

And then, today, I came home after an early morning boxing session and recorded this on the first take:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5XyRB0VFqs

Awesome right? If you look closely, not so perfect, but still kinda ok. However, that is the point: You can and should take as much advise from much better players than me as you can, but as an intermediate player, you still feel kinda alone. You might think "Yeah, he's talking like that because he plays since forever" or "That guy is so good, he cannot even remember anymore being not so good" or "Something is missing, I am doing exactly that but still not getting results". If you are reading this, you are a guitar journeyman (or journeywoman, if you prefer). These are your lonely years of travel, where you go from town to town and learn the trade you want to master. However, you might not see it, but we are legion! We are in your town, we are the ones you might not expect to play the guitar (I hear that one all the time), and if we work together, maybe we can help each other improve. 

So without further ado, what happened in the last 4 weeks, apart from me buying a new guitar? Let me tell you what I found out:

## Pick it like Hetfield
Well, first of all, if you didn't already know, James Hetfield is the god of downpicking. It's not that I say that. Dimebag Darrell said that. A lot of people much better than you and me combined said that. And it is true. And this in itself would be a fully working argument on why you should downpick Metallica songs. 

However, maybe you are atheist and therefore don't believe in gods, but then you should at least worship your instrument and honor it with ever improving your technique. Playing things _the way they are supposed to played_ is the long game. The short game is to "just make it work", which is fine. But you will only get the full reward of improvement and expansion of your guitaristic consciousness if you take on the daunting task and __pick it like Hetfield__. 

Really, it is a Hero's Journey worth undertaking. And since you are here, you have chosen to answer the Call to Adventure. 

Another thing about downpicking is, that everything else is easier after you mastered it. We grow with our challenges. I tried to cheat my way around and do some alternate picking, but it always came back to me, and made it harder than it had to be. Also, I hate to break it to everyone still doubting, but alternate picking Metallica sounds like shit and a 5 year old can hear that you are cheating. It is not that a single upstroke is discernible from a single downstroke. The thing is, you can hear the differences in the pulse signature of both pick attacks when contrasted over a long period of time and the timing will also never be exact. There will always be a certain "lighter" rhythmic feel to alternate picked lines. But you don't want a light feel. You want relentless. You want soulcrushing.  Also, all your friends will laugh at you if you do it and don't even think about the mean comments you will receive on your YouTube / Instagram video if you choose to be a cheater.

One more argument is: Well, if you cannot downpick 8ths, what are you going to do if you encounter 16th notes? You already played your "just use the upstroke as well" card. You will be caught with your pants down. Then you have to come back here, first learn how to downpick 8ths and then you can go and alternate pick 16ths. Just do it right in the beginning. My favorite Jiu Jitsu teacher and fighter, Ryan Hall once (not so famously, I know nobody but me who watched this instructional) said: "We don't care about beating white belts, blue belts, purples belts or brown belts. We care about beating black belts in the long run. And even if you don't: If you train like you want to beat them, everything else will be much easier"

The way Hetfield picks, is just standard folkstyle strumming, which follows 2 simple rules: Downpick 8ths, Alternate Pick 16ths.
It is a myth that he always downpicks. He just follows the handbook and we will see shortly that even the MoP rhythm section has got alternate picking in them. Just do it like him. Just follow the rules. Just __Obey Your Master__

## Fret it like Hetfield
Well, for the chorus you are gonna find out pretty fast that Metallica plays power chords with index finger and pinky, and so should you if want to be cool. But do as you like and you will easily see where you fail with the traditional "index, ringfinger, pinky" power chord.

## Forearm Veins that Pump with Fear
Let's talk about picking technique. Troy Grady, the creator of the "Cracking the Code" series is the person I attribute with even coming up with a proper language of talking about them, so this whole ReadMe is just a humble extension of his astonishing work. 

So let's get started with the technicalities: If you think you can play this with a wrist deviation technique, then I have to disappoint you. The muscles you move for a hand-only, girly wave is just not strong enough to attack the strings. If we take James Hetfield as the protype of a downpicker, then recall the stories of how he used to rip his strings during concerts on a regular basis. It's no coincidence it sounds so good with the palm-muting and stuff, because he really aggressively chunks into the guitar with a force you simply cannot repeatedly generate on a sustained basis with your impeccable Jazz-picking technique. 

Some people also think he uses forearm rotation, but I don't think that. I am sure you can make it work though, but it seems to me that this will be hard to do with the switching between palm-muting and non-palm-muting. Also, compare this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjjCp_QU5Qk
However, when playing around, I found that I could play the verse and the chorus at insane speeds (250bpm) with forearm rotation. But when I tried the spider riff, it would kill me. I then had to resort to strange techniques like sweeping through the E String to get to the A string to pick it in time, but this wasn't precise enough, and the double strokes on the A String for the B would always kill me. However, I have to admit, that it helped me a lot to dabble in this technique. I am not even entirely sure if I still use it a bit. 

So, what then? Well to answer this, first let me prove to you that you can already downpick master of puppets with ease. Don't believe me?
Go to https://taptempo.io/ and choose your favorite button, for example space bar or anything on the corner, and start hitting it like you dribble a basketball with only your wrist flexion. I bet that, even out of the cold, without arm support, you can easily go for something between 410bpm and 440bpm. And this is a much bigger movement than picking a string. If you can get more than 424bpm, congratulations. You could even play Master of Puppets (which has 212 bpm, which means 212 fourth notes per minute, which means 424 downpicked 8th notes per minute) with super bad and wide picking motion. 
Yes, this is the secret for the speed, precision and palm-muting endurance. You just dribble a basketball, but in reverse. You use the flexion of your hand (curling your palm towards your forarm) to reset your hand above the string, and the extension of your wrist (making your hand straight again) to smash it like some hereby unspecified master would be _smashing your dreams_. You can do this all day long. Also, if you are into drugs, this is the best way to chop them on a mirror in an astonishing fashion. But please consider quitting to fully realize your potential.

With this said, go ahead and play Master of Puppets. Wait you cannot do it yet?

## Your movement is your posture in motion
Well, I had my fair share of injuries by the way of doing martial arts, and I learned a lot of problems arise from doing things in with the improper posture. If you can bench press 100kg and you try it while being a weird side crunch with your head twisted, you will get hurt when trying to lift 30kg.
Same goes for your picking hand. Probably you even have problems trying reaching the strings with the wrist extension technique, depending on your pick size. I use a Dunlop Jazz III, which is tiny and I had problems for the longest time to use this awesome wrist extension motion to actually pluck my strings. I would just scratch the back of my fingers on the strings.
So, what would James do? (Short: WWJD?)
Well, first of all, he uses a bigger, more classic pick. Then he grips it between his thumb and both his index and middle finger. So now the finger is out of the way. Also, this facilitates extending your fingers - and thereby the pick - further from your palm. This is awesome, because now he has to move his forearm across a much shorter distance for a single pick stroke. The Arc length of a circular sector increases in proportion to it's radius. It's called math honey, look it up: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_sector#Arc_length
However, I will not be the guys who needs to change picks just for one song. Also I won't be the biggest James Hetfield fanboy in the universe and start modelling my whole guitar playing after him. If you, my dear reader, have nothing against that, you can skip the next chapter. Just practice holding the pick like him and you're good.
If you however are interested in playing this with a Jazz III, then keep reading.

## Edging out a victory
The Jazz III is made for edge picking. If you try picking the strings totally flat with it, you are not realizing it's full potential. It's like driving with brakes on. Or crushing the skulls of your enemies with an AK-47. Sure, you might be able to get to your goal, but man, there is much simpler way.
Basically it just means you twist your pick so it is not absolutely flat against the strings, but more perpendicular. If you try to do it flat, you will get a sticky, stucky feeling on plucking. Troy Grady has awesome illustrations on that on his YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeqotzwM1uY. 

Yes, edge picking changes the sound, but like I said, if you don't like it, just go and do it like Sir Hetfield. So now you have to find the proper angle for you. It can be a right angle, but probably it sits somewhere between 0 and 90 degrees. Yes, I voluntarily avoided a joke about "right" and "proper" angles. 

## Overcoming the (ad)Verse(ity)
Let's start with the simplest and most fun of the MoP riffs, the verse.
You can play this any number of different ways, and this is what you will do now. You start as slow as you need to train your fretting hand and to learn the rhythm, but then you go very fast - very fast. You must destroy the illusions that hold you back. You are able to pick fast. You must believe in it. You must do it. Only trying to go very fast in a leap of faith will allow you to understand that. 
You are tensing up? No problem mate, both the E-riff and the F#-riff are only 18 chunky palm-muted 8th notes out of 31 possible notes (consider the slides active rest), so there is plenty of time to recover and start again. 

Also, to ruin any credibility I might have built up to this point, I think of tensing up as a Trial of Fire. It purifies you of the weakness and leaves only strength. Yes, tensing up means that your muscles won't work properly. But it's mainly just the muscles you don't wanna be using anyway. The rest will be slightly impaired, but still working. I have played through tension until my elbow hurt, and then kept playing, and then my body had no other but to use what's there, which is the strong muscles in my wrist. At this point, all my tension fell instantly and I could play the riff at 250 bpm when 3 hours earlier I struggled with even 195 bpm. Your mileage may vary. 

## Come picking faster
When you can play the verse, the chorus is much easier to learn, since it is much more resting. All you have to do is to adapt your technique for some simple string changes. Now you can practice precision with your new picking technique.

## Post-Hard-Chorus
Ahh, now we have a slight increase in difficulty compared to the chorus. But if you have come here, you can easily win this battle when you have started understanding the rhythm. The main adversity is learning to string change fast enough and to start chunking away on the open A string.

## Melodic part
Come on man. This is a tutorial on downpicking.

## The Intro
Well, this one is actually easy when done right, but easy to do wrong. When we are at the lowest part of the fretboard, going from fret 2 to 1, we don't pause. This is actually hard to do. To not do a pause. If you do the pause, you will get out rhythm. This still happens a lot to me. Making a pause will also be the number 2 reason why you get sore playing creeping death. (The number 1 reason being kept secret here for reasons of not spoiling the story)

## Master, Master, where's those Upstrokes I've been after? (Pre-Solo Buildup)
Do you remember, when we talked about _the rules_? Well, here we are. This section is NOT in 212 bpm. This section is in about half of that, since it still belongs to the melodic part. This means: The fast notes on the 4th fret of the A string are alternate picked. No shit man; it's true. 
If you listen closely on the record, the first and the second stroke of that gnarly C# even sound different and come in a distinctive rhythm. You could easily downpick those 16th notes, since they are just as fast as the fast 8th notes in the other parts of the song. But it's wrong and every will be able to hear.  

Yes, after you have built up all this downstroking prowess you will have to let it go, just when you need it the most...
But your new friends have got your back! Remember the basketball? For the upstroke, you actually have to dribble it in the downwards direction (which translates into an upstroke). It will feel like crap and you will miss it all the time. And even if you hit, you will have a hard time switching back to the E String in time. So again, Troy Grady comes to the rescue and explains that we get stuck because of __wrong escape motion__.
You heard it right, you fucked up your escape and now the guards are alerted. They are after you. Time to raise the stakes and start pickslanting for this specific direction. Basically, your picking motion will not be parallel to the surface area of the fretboard anymore (if it ever was). Nope. 
Now your downstrokes pushes into the fretboard, and your upstroke goes out of it. You achieve this by pronating your wrist. Doesn't make sense in text form? Just look at this video (and all his other videos): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_yF4-mbZuY


## The Spider Riff
Motherfucker, here we are! The big face off with the dragon in the cave! The moment we've been anxiously waiting for!
You are armed. You are ready. You can now downpick the E string at 250 bpm and it sounds like a god damn machine gun. You are now officially the fastest downpicker in your city. Nothing this world ever throws at you can stop you now! You just go in the and rip it's tongue out with your bare hands. With a big smile on your face flex your biceps a little in front of the crowd, have the ladies (and boys of course) take a picture with you
But....but....BUT something feels _wrong_. You start shaking. You start tensing up. 
But how? And why? Haven't you already achieved victory against tension? You go back to taptempo.io, just to make sure this section is still in 212 bpm. It is. But you can play 250bpm. What's wrong?
Well, assuming that you don't do unconcious pauses and that you actually are able to downpick fast, here's what's wrong. But first let me tell a little story:

Back when I was a teenager, I watched Rocky for the first time at my parent's house. I was a chubby kid with who already drank a lot of alcohol and who sucked at sports. So when the training montage came, it inspired me. I used to do some pushups at Taekwondo class, but he does ONE ARMED PUSHUPS? In an instant I ran into the garden, suspended my body weight on 2 legs and a single arm and started descending. After reaching a threshold, I wanted to push back up. I couldn't. My arm gave away. And I landed _right on my nose_. 

Years later I read a book on calisthenics by Pavel Tsatsouline called _The Naked Warrior_. It is a lot less sexualized than you might think. However, he cited some research, where tension in one hand lead to contraction of the other hand. Sadly it was found out with police officers, who accidentally fired their guns held in their right hand when clenching their left hand. This is what might happen to you. 

https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.pinimg.com%2F736x%2F0f%2F10%2Fc1%2F0f10c172f88bed1b0365f52da4ff2cb1--avatar-airbender-avatar-aang.jpg&f=1&nofb=1

You see, what happens in your left hand affects your right hand. And the spider riff is some very mean and challenging fretting. 
It's called the spider riff for a reason, because the fingers move like spider-legs across the frets.
However, if you do fretting wrong, it looks more like the sausage riff. Because you are putting sausages on a grill. This might be tasty on its own, but I personally don't want to mix my sausages with spiders (I am german by the way, so I know my way around sausages).

So now you need to start cleaning up your fretting hand technique, so you dont push down your strings with your soft and fleshy finger prints (along with a very inefficient lever) but rather with your finger tips. Check this video for reference and how to do it better: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2h6Td8xPac

Now you should be ready, right? No? Okay, how about that:
Have you noticed that up until now, all our switching between palm-muted and not-palm-muted have been rather easy? Do you remember Creeping Death?
Why is it even hard to play for you anymore? You can now pick at 250 bpm. It is mainly just one finger pressing down on the A string. What's wrong?
Well: Your elbow technique is still shit. And I don't speak of Muay Thai, even though chances are, that you don't have an industry strength elbow striking technique suited for winning championships in siamese Boxing events. No. You must raise your palm again and again. But if you do it just with your forearm or wrist, you will mess with your picking. The solution is easier: Depending on if your standing or sitting, you either pull or push your elbow. When standing, you push it forward a bit to raise your palm of the string, just enought so can you still pick
When you sit, you pull your elbow back. The lever against the top corner of your guitar where your arm rests (picture coming soon) will make your arm raise just as easily.

This spider riff, you can learn from slow to fast. You already can pick fast. Now you have to use the same technique and make it clean.


## The Spider Zombie Riff after the Solo
Well, you just do what you learned in the spider riff again while working hard until relaxation captures your forearm.
Just to sum up:
- No pauses
- elbow based palm-lifting
- slight edge picking
- Downward Escape Motion

## The scale run? More like: The magic scale flight
You killed the Spider monster. Twice. You extracted it's poison and now you can return to your village to bring peace and prosperity. You are now a bona fide metal guitarist and every lesser guitarist will envy you. But suddenly the cave starts collapsing. 
You need to get out. It would be easy...if there was not a last obstacle. The dreaded scale run. You are anxious the got this whole song over with. You want to go home
You want to show the world that you have mastered Master of Puppets. No, actually, now you feel you have surpassed the god of downpicking James Hetfield himself, that you have _mastered the master of Master of Puppets_. You are Neither Master nor Puppet anymore, you have trancended every duality there ever was, and you are now more than a mortal man. But only if you get out of here alive.
So there it is. The scale run. You heart starts pumping. Then you remember, when you paid attention to the tiniest, ugliest creature on the roadside. And now this ugly creature comes back to save you. This creature? The humble build up riff. Remember when you did the upstroke even though you could have easily done just 2 downstrokes? This upstroke now has grown into adulthood. Strong enough to carry your overworked, tired body back home. 
And it's not coming alone. It has brought your new improved left hand. It has brought a mechanical spider that works on your command. It has brought Troy and Julien and Uncle Ben and all the other friends from YouTube. It has brought both playing fast right away and building up to speed. They get you of here.

You are done.

You are home. 

You can now play Hetfield's guitar in Master of Puppets.

You pick up your guitar and try to learn another song. 

Your first try fails. 

You slowly but surely wake up and realize:

You are better, but still no real god.

Maybe playing Master of Puppets isn't the treasure you always thought it was.

__Maybe The Real Treasure Was the Friends We Made Along the Way__
